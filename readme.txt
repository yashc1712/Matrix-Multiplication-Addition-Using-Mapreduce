Matrix Multiplication and Addition with Hadoop MapReduce
This project implements matrix multiplication and addition using Hadoop MapReduce. It utilizes Java and Hadoop MapReduce framework to perform these operations efficiently on large-scale datasets.

Overview
The Multiply.java file included in this repository contains the code for matrix multiplication and addition using Hadoop MapReduce. It defines mapper and reducer classes for both operations and sets up job configurations for running MapReduce tasks.

Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your_username/matrix-multiplication-addition.git

Compile the Java code:
javac -classpath ${HADOOP_CLASSPATH} -d . Multiply.java
Create input files for matrices M and N. Each file should contain comma-separated values representing the elements of the matrices.

Run the MapReduce job for matrix multiplication:
hadoop jar Multiply.jar MatrixMultiplication input/M.txt input/N.txt output_multiplication

Run the MapReduce job for matrix addition:
hadoop jar Multiply.jar MatrixAddition output_multiplication/part-r-00000 output_addition
Check the output files in the specified output directories for the result of matrix multiplication and addition.

Requirements
Java
Hadoop

Results
The output files generated by the MapReduce jobs will contain the result of matrix multiplication and addition, respectively. Each line in the output file represents an element of the resulting matrix.
